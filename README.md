## Fillomino Solver & Polyomino Tools
This project contains original solving methods for the Fillomino puzzle, implemented in C++ with a strong focus on backtracking-based search and constraint reasoning.
In addition to the solver itself, the repository provides custom fixed polyomino generation utilities and solution validation tools. <br>
The algorithms and overall approach were developed independently as part of my bachelorâ€™s thesis, with a particular emphasis on formalizing logical solving strategies and integrating them into a computational solver.
